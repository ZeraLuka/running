Project Idea for Biomedical Engineering: “Analysis of Running Speed in Different Scenarios”

Research Focus:
This project explores how various environmental and physical conditions affect running speed. Factors like terrain type (asphalt, trail), weather conditions, and runner fatigue will be analyzed to understand their impact on performance and biomechanics.

Description:
Using data from Garmin smartwatches (pace, heart rate, cadence) combined with environmental sensors, the project will analyze runners’ performance under different scenarios. AI algorithms will then provide recommendations to optimize speed and efficiency depending on conditions.

Technology:

	•	Garmin API for data collection
	•	Environmental sensors (weather, surface type)
	•	AI for pattern recognition

Application:
For optimizing athletic training and enhancing performance in variable conditions, with a focus on competitive sports and rehabilitation.
